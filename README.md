## TODO

- player level mechanics
- random/procedural environment generation
- "power mode" (player move faster + hit harder during a short amount of time when catching a special item)
- explosives
- change player stats on lvl up
- menu to show current stats (player and equipped gun)
â€‹
## TO BE FIXED

- keyboard cannot be used if a controller is plugged in (both should work independently)
- flamethrower sound is buggy (sound is played each time a flame is thrown)
